# Chronometer in Java


This project implements a chronometer in java.
We use *java.util.Timer* and *java.util.TimerTask* to do the task.
This java program can perform a count up or a count down (but you have to change the code to count down).

We have two implementations;

* chronometer1: simple implementation that resets the clock every time it is stopped
* chronometer2: enhanced version that allows to continue the count


To compile

```bash
cd chronometer1
javac Cronometro.java
```

To run

```bash
java Cronometro
```
